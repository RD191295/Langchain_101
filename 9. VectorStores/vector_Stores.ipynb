He encouraged them to be ambitious,\\nemphasized political discussions at the dinner table, and\\ndemanded a high level of academic achievement. John\\'s first\\nexposure to politics was touring the Boston wards with his\\ngrandfather Fitzgerald during his 1922 failed gubernatorial campaign.[8][9] With Joe Sr.\\'s business ventures\\nconcentrated on Wall Street and Hollywood and an outbreak of polio in Massachusetts, the family decided\\nto move from Boston to the Riverdale neighborhood of New York City in September 1927.[10][11] Several\\nyears later, his brother Robert told Look magazine that his father left Boston because of job signs that read:\\n\"No Irish Need Apply.\"[12] The Kennedys spent summers and early autumns at their home in Hyannis Port,\\nMassachusetts, a village on Cape Cod,[13] where they enjoyed swimming, sailing, and touch football.[14]\\nChristmas and Easter holidays were spent at their winter retreat in Palm Beach, Florida.[15] In September\\n1930, Kennedy, then 13 years old, was sent to the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut, for 8th\\ngrade. In April 1931, he had an appendectomy, after which he withdrew from Canterbury and recuperated\\nat home.[16]\\nIn September 1931, Kennedy started attending Choate, a preparatory boarding school in Wallingford,\\nConnecticut.[17] Rose had wanted John and Joe Jr. to attend Catholic school, but Joe Sr. thought that if they\\nwere to compete in the political world, they needed to be with boys from prominent Protestant families.[18]\\nJohn spent his first years at Choate in his older brother\\'s shadow and compensated with rebellious behavior\\nthat attracted a clique. Their most notorious stunt was exploding a toilet seat with a firecracker. In the next\\nchapel assembly, the headmaster, George St. John, brandished the toilet seat and spoke of \"muckers\" who\\nwould \"spit in our sea,\" leading Kennedy to name his group \"The Muckers Club,\" which included\\nroommate and lifelong friend Lem Billings.[19][20] Kennedy graduated from Choate in June 1935, finishing\\n64th of 112 students.[11] He had been the business manager of the school yearbook and was voted the\\n\"most likely to succeed.\"[19]\\nKennedy intended to study under Harold Laski at the London School of Economics, as his older brother\\nhad done. Ill health forced his return to the U.S. in October 1935, when he enrolled late at Princeton\\nUniversity but had to leave after two months due to gastrointestinal illness.[21]\\nIn September 1936, Kennedy enrolled at Harvard College.[22] He wrote occasionally for The Harvard\\nCrimson, the campus newspaper, but had little involvement with campus politics, preferring to concentrate\\non athletics and his social life. Kennedy played football and was on the JV squad during his sophomore\\nyear, but an injury forced him off the team, and left him with back problems that would plague him for the\\nrest of his life.

Roosevelt\\'s ambassador to the\\nCourt of St. James\\'s.[25] The following year, Kennedy traveled\\nthroughout Europe, the Soviet Union, the Balkans, and the\\nMiddle East in preparation for his Harvard senior honors\\nthesis.[26] He then went to Berlin, where a U.S. diplomatic\\nrepresentative gave him a secret message about war breaking out\\nsoon to pass on to his father, and to Czechoslovakia before\\nreturning to London on September 1, 1939, the day that\\nGermany invaded Poland and World War II began.[27] Two\\ndays later, the family was in the House of Commons for\\nspeeches endorsing the United Kingdom\\'s declaration of war on\\nGermany. Kennedy was sent as his father\\'s representative to help\\nwith arrangements for American survivors of SS Athenia before flying back to the U.S. on his first\\ntransatlantic flight.[28][29]\\nWhile Kennedy was an upperclassman at Harvard, he began to take his studies more seriously and\\ndeveloped an interest in political philosophy. He made the dean\\'s list in his junior year.[30] In 1940,\\nKennedy completed his thesis, \"Appeasement in Munich\", about British negotiations during the Munich\\nAgreement. The thesis was released on July 24, under the title Why England Slept.[31] The book was one of\\nthe first to offer information about the war and its origins, and quickly became a bestseller.[32] In addition to\\naddressing Britain\\'s unwillingness to strengthen its military in the lead-up to the war, the book called for an\\nAnglo-American alliance against the rising totalitarian powers. Kennedy became increasingly supportive of\\nU.S. intervention in World War II, and his father\\'s isolationist beliefs resulted in the latter\\'s dismissal as\\nambassador.[33]\\nIn 1940, Kennedy graduated cum laude from Harvard with a Bachelor of Arts in government,\\nconcentrating on international affairs.[34] That fall, he enrolled at the Stanford Graduate School of Business\\nand audited classes,[35] but he left after a semester to help his father complete his memoirs as an American\\nambassador. In early 1941, Kennedy toured South America.[36][37]\\nKennedy planned to attend Yale Law School, but canceled when American entry into World War II seemed\\nimminent.[38] In 1940, Kennedy attempted to enter the army\\'s Officer Candidate School. Despite months of\\ntraining, he was medically disqualified due to his chronic back problems. On September 24, 1941,\\nKennedy, with the help of the director of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and the former naval\\nattaché to Joe Sr., Alan Kirk, joined the United States Naval Reserve.

Kennedy\\'s father intervened by providing\\nmisleading medical records and convincing PT officers that his presence would bring publicity to the\\nfleet.[43] Kennedy completed six months of training at the Naval Reserve Officer Training School in\\nChicago and at the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center in Melville, Rhode Island.[40][44] His\\nU.S. Naval Reserve (1941–1945)'),\n",

Intelligence had been sent to Kennedy's Commander Thomas G.\\nWarfield expecting the arrival of the large Japanese naval force that would\\npass on the evening of August 1. Of the 24 torpedoes fired that night by\\neight of the American PTs, not one hit the Japanese convoy.[46] On that\\nmoonless night, Kennedy spotted a Japanese destroyer heading north on its\\nreturn from the base of Kolombangara around 2:00 a.m., and attempted to\\nturn to attack, when PT-109 was rammed suddenly at an angle and cut in half by the destroyer Amagiri,\\nkilling two PT-109 crew members.[47][48][41][a] Avoiding surrender, the remaining crew swam towards\\nPlum Pudding Island, 3.5 miles (5.6 km) southwest of the remains of PT-109, on August 2.[41][50] Despite\\nre-injuring his back in the collision, Kennedy towed a badly burned crewman to the island with a life jacket\\nstrap clenched between his teeth.[51] From there, Kennedy and his subordinate, Ensign George Ross, made\\nforays through the coral islands, searching for help.[52] When they encountered an English-speaking native\\nwith a canoe, Kennedy carved his location on a coconut shell and requested a boat rescue. Seven days after\\nthe collision, with the coconut message delivered, the PT-109 crew were rescued.[53][54]\\nAlmost immediately, the PT-109 rescue became a highly publicized event. The story was chronicled by\\nJohn Hersey in The New Yorker in 1944 (decades later it was the basis of a successful film).[54] It followed\\nKennedy into politics and provided a strong foundation for his appeal as a leader.[55] Hersey portrayed\\nKennedy as a modest, self-deprecating hero.[56] For his courage and leadership, Kennedy was awarded the\\nNavy and Marine Corps Medal, and the injuries he suffered during the incident qualified him for a Purple\\nHeart.[55]\\nAfter a month's recovery Kennedy returned to duty, commanding the PT-59. On November 2, Kennedy's\\nPT-59 took part with two other PTs in the rescue of 40–50 marines. The 59 acted as a shield from shore fire\\nas they escaped on two rescue landing craft at the base of the Warrior River at Choiseul Island, taking ten\\nmarines aboard and delivering them to safety.[57] Under doctor's orders, Kennedy was relieved of his\\ncommand on November 18, and sent to the hospital on Tulagi.[58] By December 1943, with his health\\ndeteriorating, Kennedy left the Pacific front and arrived in San Francisco in early January 1944.[59] After\\nreceiving treatment for his back injury at the Chelsea Naval Hospital in Massachusetts from May to\\nDecember 1944, he was released from active duty.[60][40] Beginning in January 1945, Kennedy spent three\\nCommanding P T - 1 0 9  and P T - 5 9\"),\n",

His body\\nwas never recovered.[65][66] The news reached the family\\'s home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts a day\\nlater. Kennedy felt that Joe Jr.\\'s reckless flight was partly an effort to outdo him.[67][68] To console himself,\\nKennedy set out to assemble a privately published book of remembrances of his brother, As We Remember\\nJoe.[69]\\nIn April 1945, Kennedy\\'s father, who was a friend of William Randolph Hearst, arranged a position for his\\nson as a special correspondent for Hearst Newspapers; the assignment kept Kennedy\\'s name in the public\\neye and \"expose[d] him to journalism as a possible career.\"[70] That May he went to Berlin as a\\ncorrespondent,[71] covering the Potsdam Conference and other events.[72]\\nKennedy\\'s elder brother Joe Jr. had been the family\\'s political standard-bearer and had been tapped by their\\nfather to seek the presidency. After Joe\\'s death, the assignment fell to JFK as the second eldest.[73] Boston\\nmayor Maurice J. Tobin discussed the possibility of John becoming his running mate in 1946 as a candidate\\nfor Massachusetts lieutenant governor, but Joe Sr. preferred a congressional campaign that could send John\\nto Washington, where he could have national visibility.[74]\\nAt the urging of Kennedy\\'s father, U.S. Representative James\\nMichael Curley vacated his seat in the strongly Democratic 11th\\ncongressional district of Massachusetts to become mayor of Boston\\nin 1946.

He also supported public housing and\\nopposed the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, which restricted the power of labor unions. Though\\nnot as vocally anti-communist as Joseph McCarthy, Kennedy supported the Immigration and Nationality\\nAct of 1952, which required communists to register with the government, and he deplored the \"loss of\\nChina.\"[79] During a speech in Salem, Massachusetts on January 30, 1949, Kennedy denounced Truman\\nand the State Department for contributing to the \"tragic story of China whose freedom we once fought to\\npreserve. What our young men had saved [in World War II], our diplomats and our President have frittered\\naway.\"[80][81]\\nIn November 1947, Kennedy delivered a speech in Congress supporting a $227 million aid package to\\nItaly. He maintained that Italy was in danger from an \"onslaught of the communist minority\" and that the\\ncountry was the \"initial battleground in the communist drive to capture Western Europe.\"[82] This speech\\nwas calculated to appeal to the large Italian-American voting bloc in Massachusetts as Kennedy was\\nbeginning to position himself for statewide office. To combat Soviet efforts to take control in Middle\\nEastern and Asian countries like Indochina, Kennedy wanted the United States to develop nonmilitary\\ntechniques of resistance that would not create suspicions of neoimperialism or add to the country\\'s financial\\nburden. The problem, as he saw it, was not simply to be anti-communist but to stand for something that\\nthese emerging nations would find appealing.[83]\\nHaving served as a boy scout during his childhood, Kennedy was active in the Boston Council from 1946\\nto 1955 as district vice chairman, member of the executive board, vice-president, and National Council\\nRepresentative.[84][85] Almost every weekend that Congress was in session, Kennedy would fly back to\\nMassachusetts to give speeches to veteran, fraternal, and civic groups, while maintaining an index card file\\non individuals who might be helpful for a campaign for statewide office.[86] Contemplating whether to run\\nfor the U.S. Senate or governor of Massachusetts, Kennedy abandoned interest in the latter, believing that\\nthe governor \"sat in an office, handing out sewer contracts.\"[87]\\nAs early as 1949, Kennedy began\\npreparing to run for the Senate in 1952\\nagainst Republican three-term\\nincumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. with\\nthe campaign slogan \"KENNEDY\\nWILL DO MORE FOR\\nMASSACHUSETTS\".[88] Joe Sr.\\nagain financed his son\\'s candidacy\\n(persuading the Boston Post to switch\\nits support to Kennedy by promising the publisher a $500,000 loan),[89] while John\\'s younger brother\\nRobert emerged as campaign manager.[90] Kennedy\\'s mother and sisters contributed as highly effective\\ncanvassers by hosting a series of \"teas\" at hotels and parlors across Massachusetts to reach out to women\\nvoters.[91][92] In the presidential election, Republican Dwight D.

Although Kennedy\\'s and Lodge\\'s legislative records were similarly\\nliberal, Lodge voted for the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 and Kennedy voted against it. On NBC\\'s Meet the\\nPress, Kennedy excoriated Lodge for not doing enough to prevent the increasing migration of\\nmanufacturing jobs from Massachusetts to the South, and blamed the right-to-work provision for giving the\\nSouth an unfair advantage over Massachusetts in labor costs.[97] In May 1953, Kennedy introduced \"The\\nEconomic Problems of New England\",[98] a 36-point program to help Massachusetts industries such as\\nfishing, textile manufacturing, watchmaking, and shipbuilding, as well as the Boston seaport.[99] Kennedy\\'s\\npolicy agenda included protective tariffs, preventing excessive speculation in raw wool, stronger efforts to\\nresearch and market American fish products, an increase in the Fish and Wildlife Service budget,\\nmodernizing reserve-fleet vessels, tax incentives to prevent further business relocations, and the\\ndevelopment of hydroelectric and nuclear power in Massachusetts.[100][101][102] Kennedy\\'s suggestions for\\nstimulating the region\\'s economy appealed to both parties by offering benefits to business and labor, and\\npromising to serve national defense. Congress would eventually enact most of the program.[99] Kennedy, a\\nMassachusetts Audubon Society supporter, wanted to make sure that the shorelines of Cape Cod remained\\nunsullied by industrialization.

In August 1963, Henry Cabot\\nLodge Jr. replaced Frederick Nolting as the U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam. Days after his arrival in\\nSouth Vietnam, Lodge reported that several South Vietnamese generals sought the assent of the U.S.\\ngovernment to their plan of removing Diem from power. The Kennedy administration was split regarding\\nnot just the removal of Diem, but also their assessment of the military situation and the proper U.S. role in\\nthe country.

Kennedy rejected the full-scale deployment of ground soldiers but also the total withdrawal\\nof U.S. forces.[252] Historians disagree on whether the U.S. military presence in Vietnam would have\\nescalated had Kennedy survived and been re-elected in 1964.[253] Fueling the debate are statements made\\nby Secretary of Defense McNamara in the 2003 documentary film The Fog of War that Kennedy was\\nstrongly considering pulling out of Vietnam after the 1964 election.[254] Kennedy had signed NSAM 263,\\ndated October 11, which ordered the withdrawal of 1,000 military personnel by the end of the\\nyear.[255][256] Such an action would have been a policy reversal, but Kennedy was moving in a less\\nhawkish direction since his acclaimed speech about world peace at American University on June 10,\\n1963.[257]\\nIn 1963, Germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to Soviet aggression to the east as\\nwell as the impending retirement of West German Chancellor Adenauer.[258] At the same time, French\\nPresident Charles de Gaulle was trying to build a Franco-West German counterweight to the American and\\nSoviet spheres of influence.[259][260][261] To Kennedy\\'s eyes, this Franco-German cooperation seemed\\ndirected against NATO\\'s influence in Europe.[262]\\nTo reinforce the U.S. alliance with West Germany, Kennedy travelled to West Germany and West Berlin in\\nJune 1963. On June 26, Kennedy toured West Berlin, culminating in a public speech at the city hall in front\\nof hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic Berliners.[263] He reiterated the American commitment to\\nGermany and criticized communism and was met with an ecstatic response from the massive audience.[264]\\nKennedy used the construction of the Berlin Wall as an example of the failures of communism: \"Freedom\\nWest Berlin speech'),\n",

The Area\\nRedevelopment Act, a $394 million program, provided federal funding to economically struggling regions\\n(primarily in Appalachia), while the Housing Act of 1961 provided funds for urban renewal and public\\nhousing and authorized federal mortgage loans to those who did not qualify for public housing.[294]\\nKennedy proposed a bill providing for $2.3 billion in federal educational aid to the states, with more money\\ngoing to states with lower per capita income.

The predictions according to the Keynesian model indicated the cuts would decrease income taxes\\nby about $10 billion and corporate taxes by about $3.5 billion. The plan included reforms designed to\\nreduce the impact of itemized deductions, as well as provisions to help the elderly and handicapped.\\nRepublicans and many Southern Democrats opposed the bill, calling for simultaneous reductions in\\nexpenditures, but debate continued throughout 1963.[304] Three months after Kennedy died, Johnson\\npushed the plan through Congress. The Revenue Act of 1964 lowered the top individual rate to 70 percent,\\nand the top corporate rate to 48 percent.[305]\\nKennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies, loosening monetary\\npolicy to keep interest rates down and to encourage growth of the\\neconomy.[306] He presided over the first government budget to top\\nthe $100 billion mark, in 1962, and his first budget in 1961 resulted\\nin the nation's first non-war, non-recession deficit.[307] The\\neconomy, which had been through two recessions in three years\\nand was in one when Kennedy took office, accelerated notably\\nthroughout his administration.

By\\nSeptember 1961, the ICC ruled in favor of the petition.[323]\\nOn March 6, 1961, Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925, which required government contractors to\\n\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during\\nemployment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\"[324] It established the President\\'s\\nCommittee on Equal Employment Opportunity.[325]\\nIn September 1962, James Meredith enrolled at the all-White University of Mississippi but was prevented\\nfrom entering.

Kennedy took the latter occasion as an\\nopportunity to deliver another speech promoting the space effort on\\nSeptember 12, 1962, in which he said:\\nNo nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can\\nexpect to stay behind in this race for space. ... We choose to go\\nto the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because\\nthey are easy, but because they are hard.[364] Full text \\nOn November 21, 1962, in a cabinet meeting with Webb and other\\nofficials, Kennedy explained that the Moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige, and that\\nthe expense was justified.[365] On July 20, 1969, almost six years after Kennedy's death, Apollo 11 landed\\nthe first crewed spacecraft on the Moon.[366]\\nIn 1962, Kennedy appointed justices Byron White and Arthur Goldberg to the Supreme Court.[367]\\nAdditionally, Kennedy appointed 21 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 102 judges to the\\nUnited States district courts.[368]\\nKennedy was assassinated in Dallas at 12:30 p.m. Central Standard Time on November 22, 1963. He was\\nin Texas on a political trip to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party between liberals Ralph\\nYarborough and Don Yarborough (no relation) and conservative John Connally.[369] Traveling in a\\npresidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza, he was shot once in the back, the bullet exiting via his throat,\\nand once in the head.[370]\\nKennedy was taken to Parkland Hospital, where he was pronounced dead 30 minutes later, at\\n1:00 p.m.[371] He was 46 years old. Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the murder of police officer J. D.\\nTippit and was subsequently charged with Kennedy's assassination. He denied shooting anyone, claiming\\nhe was a patsy,[372][373] and was shot dead by Jack Ruby on November 24, before he could be prosecuted.\\nRuby was arrested and convicted for the murder of Oswald. Ruby successfully appealed his conviction but\\ndied of cancer on January 3, 1967, while the date for his new trial was being set.\\nPresident Johnson quickly issued an executive order to create the Warren Commission—chaired by Chief\\nJustice Earl Warren—to investigate the assassination. The commission concluded that Oswald acted alone\\nin killing Kennedy and that Oswald was not part of any conspiracy.[374] These conclusions are disputed by\\nJudicial appointments\\nAssassination\"),\n",

Although Eisenhower had\\nallowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television,\\nKennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcast live\\nand made good use of the medium.[397] In 1961, the Radio-\\nTelevision News Directors Association presented Kennedy with its\\nhighest honor, the Paul White Award, in recognition of his open\\nrelationship with the media.[398]\\nThe Kennedys invited a range of artists, writers and intellectuals to\\nWhite House dinners, raising the profile of the arts in America.

He then spent the\\nspring of 1936 working as a ranch hand outside Benson, Arizona under\\nJack Speiden.[405]\\nYears after Kennedy\\'s death, it was revealed that in September 1947, while\\nKennedy was 30 and in his first term in Congress, he was diagnosed by Sir\\nDaniel Davis at The London Clinic with Addison\\'s disease. Davis estimated\\nthat Kennedy would not live for another year, while Kennedy hoped he\\ncould live for ten.[406] In 1966, White House physician Janet Travell\\nrevealed that Kennedy also had hypothyroidism. The presence of two\\nendocrine diseases raises the possibility that Kennedy had autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type\\n2.[407]\\nKennedy suffered from chronic severe back pain, for which he had surgery. Kennedy\\'s condition may have\\nhad diplomatic repercussions, as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to treat back pain\\nduring the 1961 Vienna Summit. The combination included hormones, animal organ cells, steroids,\\nvitamins, enzymes, and amphetamines, and possible side effects included hyperactivity, hypertension,\\nimpaired judgment, nervousness, and mood swings.[408] Kennedy at one time was regularly seen by three\\ndoctors, one of whom, Max Jacobson, was unknown to the other two, as his mode of treatment was\\ncontroversial[409] and used for the most severe bouts of back pain.[410]\\nInto late 1961, disagreements existed among Kennedy\\'s doctors concerning the balance of medication and\\nexercise. Kennedy preferred the former because he was short on time and desired immediate relief.[285] The\\npresident\\'s physician, George Burkley, set up some gym equipment in the White House basement, where\\nKennedy did stretching exercises thrice weekly.[411] Details of these and other medical problems were not\\npublicly disclosed during Kennedy\\'s lifetime.[412] The President\\'s primary White House physician, George\\nBurkley, realized that treatments by Jacobson and Travell, including the excessive use of steroids and\\namphetamines, were medically inappropriate, and took action to remove Kennedy from their care.[413]\\nIn 2002, Robert Dallek wrote an extensive history of Kennedy\\'s\\nhealth based on a collection of Kennedy-associated papers from\\n1955 to 1963, including X-rays and prescription records from\\nTravell.

According to historian Michael Beschloss, in July\\n1963, Hoover reportedly informed Robert Kennedy about the affair with a woman \"suspected as a Soviet\\nintelligence agent, someone linked to East German intelligence.\" Robert Kennedy reportedly took the\\nmatter sufficiently seriously to raise it with leading Democratic and Republican figures in\\nCongress.[425][426] Former Secret Service agent Larry Newman recalled \"morale problems\" that the\\npresident\\'s indiscretions engendered within the Secret Service.[427]\\nKennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters.[428] According to\\nReeves, this included \"the logistics of Kennedy\\'s liaisons ...
