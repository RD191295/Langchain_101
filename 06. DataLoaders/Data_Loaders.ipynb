      "impossible.  You're just asking to be made a fool of, because these\n",
      "are such powerful forces.  [2]For example, initially I thought maybe this principle only applied\n",

      "startups is that you get a lot of data about how they work.  From\n",
      "what we've seen, being good seems to help startups in three ways:\n",

      "problem with feeling you're doomed is not just that it makes you\n",

      "of the roller-coaster are more of a self fulfilling prophecy than\n",

      "people, you'll keep working even when it seems like your startup\n",
      "is doomed.  Most of us have some amount of natural benevolence.\n",

      "good for people gives you a sense of mission that makes you harder\n",
      "to kill, that alone more than compensates for whatever you lose by\n",
      "not choosing a more selfish project.HelpAnother advantage of being good is that it makes other people want\n",
      "to help you.  This too seems to be an inborn trait in humans.One of the startups we've funded, Octopart, is currently locked in\n",
      "a classic battle of good versus evil.  They're a search site for\n",
      "industrial components.  A lot of people need to search for components,\n",

      "than I do with most of the other startups we've funded.  It just\n",
      "made me spend several minutes telling you how great they are.  Why?\n",
      "Because they're good guys and they're trying to help the world.If you're benevolent, people will rally around you: investors,\n",
      "customers, other companies, and potential employees.  In the long\n",
      "term the most important may be the potential employees.  I think\n",
      "everyone knows now that \n",
      "good hackers are much better than mediocre\n",
      "ones.  If you can attract the best hackers to work for you, as\n",
      "Google has, you have a big advantage.  And the very best hackers\n",
      "tend to be idealistic.  They're not desperate for a job.  They can\n",
      "work wherever they want.  So most want to work on things that will\n",
      "make the world better.CompassBut the most important advantage of being good is that it acts as\n",
      "a compass.  One of the hardest parts of doing a startup is that you\n",
      "have so many choices.  There are just two or three of you, and a\n",
      "thousand things you could do. How do you decide?Here's the answer: Do whatever's best for your users.  You can hold\n",
      "onto this like a rope in a hurricane, and it will save you if\n",
      "anything can.  Follow it and it will take you through everything\n",
      "you need to do.It's even the answer to questions that seem unrelated, like how to\n",
      "convince investors to give you money.  If you're a good salesman,\n",
      "you could try to just talk them into it.  But the more reliable\n",
      "route is to convince them through your users: if you make something\n",
      "users love enough to tell their friends, you grow exponentially,\n",
      "and that will convince any investor.Being good is a particularly useful strategy for making decisions\n",
      "in complex situations because it's stateless.  It's like telling\n",
      "the truth.  The trouble with lying is that you have to remember\n",
      "everything you've said in the past to make sure you don't contradict\n",
      "yourself.  If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything,\n",
      "and that's a really useful property in domains where things happen\n",
      "fast.For example, Y Combinator has now invested in 80 startups, 57 of\n",
      "which are still alive.  (The rest have died or merged or been\n",
      "acquired.)  When you're trying to advise 57 startups, it turns out\n",
      "you have to have a stateless algorithm.  You can't have ulterior\n",
      "motives when you have 57 things going on at once, because you can't\n",
      "remember them.  So our rule is just to do whatever's best for the\n",
      "founders.  Not because we're particularly benevolent, but because\n",
      "it's the only algorithm that works on that scale.When you write something telling people to be good, you seem to be\n",
      "claiming to be good yourself.  So I want to say explicitly that I\n",
      "am not a particularly good person.  When I was a kid I was firmly\n",
      "in the camp of bad.  The way adults used the word good, it seemed\n",
      "to be synonymous with quiet, so I grew up very suspicious of it.You know how there are some people whose names come up in conversation\n",
      "and everyone says \"He's such a great guy?\"  People never say\n",
      "that about me.  The best I get is \"he means well.\"  I am not claiming\n",
      "to be good.  At best I speak good as a second language.So I'm not suggesting you be good in the usual sanctimonious way.\n",
      "I'm suggesting it because it works.  It will work not just as a\n",
      "statement of \"values,\" but as a guide to strategy,\n",
      "and even a design spec for software.  Don't just not be evil.  Be\n",
      "good.Notes[1] Fifty years ago\n",
      "it would have seemed shocking for a public company not to pay\n",
      "dividends.  Now many tech companies don't.  The markets seem to\n",
      "have figured out how to value potential dividends.  Maybe that isn't\n",
      "the last step in this evolution.  Maybe markets will eventually get\n",
      "comfortable with potential earnings. (VCs already are, and at least\n",
      "some of them consistently make money.)I realize this sounds like the stuff one used to hear about the\n",
      "\"new economy\" during the Bubble.  Believe me, I was not drinking\n",
      "that kool-aid at the time.  But I'm convinced there were some \n",
      "good\n",
      "ideas buried in Bubble thinking.  For example, it's ok to focus on\n",
      "growth instead of profitsâ€”but only if the growth is genuine.\n",
      "You can't be buying users; that's a pyramid scheme.   But a company\n",
      "with rapid, genuine growth is valuable, and eventually markets learn\n",
      "how to value valuable things.[2] The idea of starting\n",
      "a company with benevolent aims is currently undervalued, because\n",
      "the kind of people who currently make that their explicit goal don't\n",
      "usually do a very good job.It's one of the standard career paths of trustafarians to start\n",
      "some vaguely benevolent business.  The problem with most of them\n",
      "is that they either have a bogus political agenda or are feebly\n",
      "executed.  The trustafarians' ancestors didn't get rich by preserving\n",
      "their traditional culture; maybe people in Bolivia don't want to\n",
      "either.  And starting an organic farm, though it's at least\n",
      "straightforwardly benevolent, doesn't help people on the scale that\n",

      "Tesla was founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk joined as Tesla's largest shareholder; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally. In 2023, the Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally. In January 2024, the Model Y became the best-selling BEV in history.\n",

In October 2021, Tesla temporarily became a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to do so, and did so again in November 2024. In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.\n",
      "Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company's driving assist technology and product release timelines.\n",

Eberhard said that he wanted to build \"a car manufacturer that is also a technology company\", with its core technologies as \"the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor\".\n",
      "Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joined a few months later. In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12 million in 2023) in series A funding, including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10 million in 2023) from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla. J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.\n",

      "In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team. Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll. A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.\n",

      "tasks (Qiao et al., 2023; Huang & Chang, 2023), marking a significant leap that bridges the gap\n",
      "between human and machine intelligence. However, LLMs still struggle with conducting faithful\n",
      "reasoning due to issues of lack of knowledge and hallucination (Huang et al., 2024; Wang et al.,\n",
      "2023). These issues result in factual errors and flawed reasoning processes (Nguyen et al., 2024),\n",
      "which greatly undermine the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.\n",
      "To address these issues, many studies utilize knowledge graphs (KGs), which encapsulate extensive\n",
      "factual information in a structured format, to improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs (Pan et al.,\n",
      "2024; Luo et al., 2024). Nevertheless, because of the unstructured nature of LLMs, directly applying\n",
      "them to reason on KGs is challenging.\n",

      "methods (Sun et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024) treat LLMs as agents that iteratively\n",
