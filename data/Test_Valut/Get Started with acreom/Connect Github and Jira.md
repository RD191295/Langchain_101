Using integrations, you can:

- Add page to pull request
- Link any Issues or PRs to your page
- Break down Jira issues and add personal context


Once you are done, you can easily access the linked issue and PRs, which enables you to change the status and hit merge in seconds.

### Suggested Workflow
1. Select an issue / PR you are working on.
2. Create a new page for the issue by clicking the '+' button on the issue / PR.
3. Break the issue / PR into smaller tasks on the page.
4. Use the `/` command to add relevant links and documents from your knowledge base.
5. Set a page status for visibility in the Active view.
6. Complete and archive the page upon task completion, adding it to your long-term knowledge base.
